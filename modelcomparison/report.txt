Q3.1

Linear Regression - 
	Training Accuracy: 86%
	Testing Accuracy: 82% 

SVM -
	Training Accuracy: 98%
	Testing Accuracy: 96%

MLP - 
	Training Accuracy: 100%
	Testing Accuracy: 81%

Random Forest - 
	Training Accuracy: 100%

Q3.2 - Hyperparameter tuning

Random Forest - 
	n_estimators values tested (at least 3): 10, 20, 50

	max_depth values tested (at least 3): 2, 10, 20
		
	Best combination of parameter values:
		n_estimators: 50
		max_depth: 20

	Testing Accuracy before tuning (default parameters): 95%
	Testing Accuracy after tuning: 96%


SVM -
	Kernels values tested: rbf, linear
	C values tested (at least 3): 0.1, 1, 10
		
	Best combination of parameter values: 
		Kernel: rbf
		C: 10

	Testing Accuracy before tuning (default parameters): 96% 
	Testing Accuracy after tuning: 97%

Q3.3

For your SVM's CV run from Q3.2, state the highest mean testing accuracy 
across the sets of parameter values and its corresponding mean train score and mean fit time. 

SVM's highest mean testing/cross-validated accuracy (best score): 97%
SVM's mean train score: 100%
SVM's mean fit time: 0.14

Q3.4

Best Classifier: Random forest
Why: Gives a good accuracy even before tuning and also its fits faster. SVC gives slightly better accuracy but takes a long time to fit. So if accuracy is important then I would use SVC but in general cases I will use Random forest.
